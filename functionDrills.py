#1) Define a function that subtracts the second number from the first number. Return the result.
def subraction(num1,num2):
    differenceOfTwo = num2 - num1
    return differenceOfTwo

#2) Define a function that divides a number by 2, multiplies it by 77, and then adds 10000. Return the result.
def quotient(num1):
    crazyFunction = ((num1/2)*77+10000
    return crazyFuntion
#3) Define a function that checks if two numbers are equal. If they are equal, return true. If they are not equal, return false.
def equality(num1, num2):
    b= num1 == num2
    return b
#4) Define a function that takes in two numbers and returns the larger number. If they are the same, it should just return that number.
def greater(num1, num2):
    greater_than = b>a
    return b
#5) Define a function that takes in two words and returns a string that contains both words combined.
def two_words(word1, word2):
    combine_the_words= word1 + word2
    return combine_the_words
#6) Define a function that takes in three numbers. If the first number is equal to the second OR the third number, return true. Else, return false.
def compare_three_numbers(num1,num2,num3):
    result= (num1==num2) or (num1==num3)
    return result
#7) Define a function that prints your name.
def name(Justin):
    result= Justin
    return result
print(Justin)
#8) Define a function that takes in a string that is the name of a color. If that string is equal to your favorite color, it prints "That's my favorite color!" If it is not, it prints "That is not my favorite color. Try again."
def compare_colors(fav, color):
    if color== fav :
        print("That's my favorite color")
    else:
        print("Thats not my favorite color, try again")
#9) Define a function that takes in a number. If the number is not equal to zero, the function runs a loop until the number reaches 0. HINT: Within the loop, keep subtracting 1 from the number.
def compare_two_numbers(num1,num2):
    num1=4
    while num1 > 0:
        print(num1)
        num1 -=1
'''YOUR OWN FUNCTION'''
   

#10) Create your own function that solves any problem you can think of.
def Justin(Yang, Justin):
    if Yang==Justin:
        print("That is my nickname")
    else:
        print("That is not my nickname...You really don't know me...")
